## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice C++ structured programming and arrays.  
- Learn to use ready-made libraries (`stb_image`, `Image_Class`).  
- Understand basic concepts of **image processing** (grayscale, invert, brightness, edge detection).  
- Apply teamwork using **GitHub workflow** (init, clone, add, commit, push).

## 📂 GitHub Workflow
- Private repository created on GitHub.  
- Steps followed by the team:  
  1. `git init`  
  2. `git clone`  
  3. `git add`  
  4. `git commit`  
  5. `git push`  

Each member contributes their filters and commits separately.

## 📅 Deadlines
- **Part 1:** 1 Oct 2025 → Any 6 filters + menu.  
- **Hero / Beast:** 10 Oct 2025 → 12 or 15 filters.  
- **Winged Dragon:** 15 Oct 2025 → 18+ filters + GUI.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project allowed us to:  
- Refresh our **C++ syntax**.  
- Learn to collaborate as a team on **GitHub**.  
- Gain first-hand experience with **image processing basics**.  
- Implement filters similar to real-world editors like Photoshop.
